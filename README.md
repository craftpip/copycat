# Copycat 

Copycat downloads your spotify playlists and syncs it on your local drive.

:heart: spotify     
v1.0.0

As working in an IT company we dont have access to our phones on work, that means no spotify, 
i have no choice but to keep my walkman in sync with my playlists, which gets boring after a while.
this tools does it for me, downloads the songs adds ID3 tags and keeps the download folder in sync with my walkman, 
finally i can live in peace.

## Flow?

- Searches the track on youtube
- Downloads the bestest available audio format of the song that has the least difference in play length
- Converts the file to mp3
- Adds ID3 tags and albumart to it
- Makes an exact copy of your playlists as folders on disk
- Syncs the playlist folders with a target drive (my walkman)
- very cool :ok_hand:
